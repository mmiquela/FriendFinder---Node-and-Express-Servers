# FriendFinder---Node-and-Express-Servers

This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in 
results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display 
the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

This uses Express to handle routing. App will be deployed to Heroku so other users can fill it out.
